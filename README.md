<pre><code>```bash /src /component Navbar.tsx # Responsive top navigation bar with theme switcher & mobile menu Sidebar.tsx # Sidebar navigation component used in dark mode (theme2) /context ThemeProvider.tsx # React Context for theme state management and persistence /pages Home.tsx # Home page fetching and displaying products from API About.tsx # Static about page (you can customize) Contact.tsx # Static contact page (you can customize) /theme theme.ts # Theme styles (Tailwind CSS classes) for different UI parts App.tsx # Main app layout applying themes & routing config index.tsx # Entry point, app bootstrapping with router and theme provider ``` </code></pre>---

## Usage Instructions

- **Switch Themes**  
  Use the dropdown menu in the navbar (desktop) or mobile menu to select between the three available themes. The app's colors, typography, layout, and styles will update instantly.

- **Navigate Pages**  
  Use the navigation links in the navbar or sidebar to switch between Home, About, and Contact pages.

- **Mobile Navigation**  
  On small screens, tap the hamburger icon to open a sliding menu with navigation and theme selector. Tap outside or the close icon to dismiss.

## Customization

- **Adding Themes**  
  Extend `src/theme/theme.ts` with new theme objects following the existing structure. Add a `name` property for display, and provide Tailwind CSS class strings for layout, navbar, sidebar, cards, buttons etc.

- **Pages**  
  Edit or replace the components in `/pages` to add your own content.

- **Styling**  
  Adjust Tailwind configuration or add custom CSS in `index.css` or component-specific styles as needed.

## Accessibility

- Semantic HTML and ARIA attributes are used for buttons and inputs.
- Keyboard accessible menu toggles.
- Proper focus styles using Tailwind focus utilities.
- Responsive for various screen sizes.

## Dependencies

- react
- react-dom
- react-router-dom
- lucide-react (icons)
- axios
- tailwindcss (plus autoprefixer & postcss)
- typescript

---

## Known Issues

- Theme persistence relies on localStorage and applies CSS classes to `document.body`. Adjust if you have conflicting body classes.
- Sidebar for Theme 2 is fixed width, may need layout tuning on very small desktop screens.
- API data depends on Fake Store API availability.
